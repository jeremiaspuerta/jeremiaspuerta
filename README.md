Hi there! 👋🏼

  
😄 I'm Jeremias Puerta from Mendoza, Argentina. 
  
👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Full Stack Software Developer on an important internet company from my city since 2020. There, I work with PHP,Laravel, MySQL, ReactJS, MongoDB and Docker, and sometimes I have to do some stuffs on Ubuntu Server's. 

🧑🏻‍🎓 I'm currently learning TypeScript with NextJS. Also, I'm a studying Computer Science and Software Development at Aconcagua University.

  
🍕🎞️  Besides develop software, I'm a pizza and movie lover. I enjoy a lot to eat differents kind of pizza and watch horror movies. I'm going to publish some app that mix both soon?👀 ... I don't know, you tell me  🤫
